## Project

I was feeling a little bit left behind by not having a todo app in my github so I decided to create one! Even though it is a fairly beginner project, I believe this is the first time that I've done it with TypeScript and Vite. Quite interesting!

## Learnings

I have been a little rusty on the TypeScript front so this project was very good for me to learn how to type HTML element-based events properly and to remember how to style a checkbox manually.

Vite is cool and it is definitely a step up from the old `create-react-app`. As of today, I can see myself using this in situations where Next JS would be a bit overkill (such as this project).
